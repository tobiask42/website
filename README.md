# Personal Website

This is a bilingual, accessible personal website (German/English) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).  
It is designed for privacy-compliant personal use and includes:

- A contact form powered by [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com)
- A configurable linktree homepage via environment variables
- Translations via [`next-intl`](https://next-intl.dev)
- Accessible by design (keyboard navigation, skip links, proper structure)
- Legal pages (Impressum & Datenschutz) pre-filled for non-commercial usage

## Features

- **Bilingual routing** with language switcher
- **Custom linktree** controlled via environment variables
- **Accessible form** with field grouping, labels, focus states, and honeypot spam protection
- **No cookies, no tracking** by default
- Designed for **deployment on Vercel**, but portable

## Environment Configuration

All dynamic content is controlled via `.env` variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL=mail@example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_TITLE=Webpage Title
NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKTREE_NAME=Linktree Heading

NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKTREE_EN=Contact Form>/contact,Example>https://example.com,Example2>https://example2.com
```
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKTREE_DE` and `EN` to define language-specific link lists
- Use `Label>URL` format, separated by commas
- One entry must be `/contact` to activate the form route
